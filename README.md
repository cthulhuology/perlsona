Mozilla Persona authenticated websocket connections for Mojolicious applications


WARNING
=======

This is currently a proof of concept and is not intented for production use.  It will eventually be a proper module that you can add to any Mojolicious application.

Currently, I'm using carton for package management, perlbrew for perl management, and recommend you do the same.
